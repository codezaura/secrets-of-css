Then, you can start writing properties for elements like

```html
<head>
  <style>
    .box {
      width: 100px;
      height: 100px;
      background-color: crimson;
     }
  </style>
</head>

<body>
  <div class="box"></div>
</body>
```

> [!note]
>
> Propertis are written in the form of `key: value` pairs.
>
> `color: red`\
> color --> key and red --> value

**Wow! You've added some value 🎖️**
