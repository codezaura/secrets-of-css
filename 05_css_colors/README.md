In CSS, There are multiple ways to declare colors.

And here are the most used color declaring methods:
- Color Name: `red`, `blue`, `crimson`, `hotpink` etc.
- RGB: `color: rgb(255, 255, 255)`
> [!note]\
> In `RGB` each value varies from 0 to 255
>
> To change opacity value\
> `rgba()`, where a indicates alpha value of color which varies from 0 to 1.

- Hexa Decimals: `color: #ffffff`
> [!note]\
> You won't believe\
> Declaring Hexa-Decimal color values are very efficient as
>
> ```css
> color: #fff;
> color: #fafafa;
> ```
>
> You can declare CSS color values using 3 or 6 letters.\
> These letters vary from [0-9] + [a-f]
>
> To change opacity value\
> `#fff0` or `#fafafa10`
